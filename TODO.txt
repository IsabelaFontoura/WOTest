- method for converting command line arguments into absolute paths if they don't start with a / (based on CWD env variable? or NSProcessInfo?)

- Add information on code coverage testing to docs:

    http://www.supermegaultragroovy.com/Software%20Development/xcode_code_coverage_howto

- Describe how to run tests under a debugger? WOTestRunner

- for consistency, make a WOClassStub class (inherits from WOObjectStub) to mirror set up in WOClassMock and WOObjectMock

- further to thoughts on Higher-Order Messaging here:

Think about alternative syntax for mock objects; instead of:

    [[mock expect] returning:@"foo"] substringfromIndex:3];

Consider:

    [mock expectSelector:@selector(substringFromIndex:)
                  return:@"foo"
               arguments:3];

Regressions:

- write WOMultithreadedCrash class for WOTest (regression test for multithreaded low level exception handling failure); for now just
WO_TEST_FAIL

- also write WOLocaleFormatterCrash class (copy and refactor WOLocaleFormatter class and tests so that the WOCommon crash problem
can be manifested  in the WOTest tests); again, for now will just be WO_TEST_FAIL

- for Leopard: use RubyCocoa bridge for writing specs in Ruby
